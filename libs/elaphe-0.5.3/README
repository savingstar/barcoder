Elaphe

Elaphe is a python binding for the Barcode Writer In Pure PostScript
(http://www.terryburton.co.uk/barcodewriter/). It is a thin-wrapper
which employs Python Imaging Library as PostScript rendering interface.

Requirements
============

* Python 2.5 or later (functional decorators, ternary operator, and 
  generator expressions are used).

* If you want to render the generated barcode, Python Imaging Library
  (http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil) is required under the
  condition that EpsImagePlugin is enabled (i.e. at least you must
  have Ghostscript is installed and callable from PIL).

Simple Usage
============

The following example::

  >>> from elaphe import barcode
  >>> barcode('qrcode',
  ...         'Hello Barcode Writer In Pure PostScript.',
  ...         options=dict(version=9, eclevel='M'), 
  ...         margin=10, data_mode='8bits'))   # Generates PIL.EpsImageFile instance
  <PIL.EpsImagePlugin.EpsImageFile instance at ...>
  >>> _.show()            # Show the image

should invoke default viewer which shows a QRcode symbol with 10px margin.

Remember, barcode() returns PIL image object.
